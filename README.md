# AIRoadmap
I want to know more about machine learning. I want to know more about artificial intelligence. This is a place to document my roadmap and my journey.

# Math Refresher
To Start, I am going to go through these documents to review the math used within artifical intellgience algorithms.

# Machine-Learning Specific Texts
After, or really while, refreshing myself on the math, I am going to go through the following textbooks/modules.
